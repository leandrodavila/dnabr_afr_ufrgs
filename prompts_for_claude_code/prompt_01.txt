Context:

I need to create a python application that will evaluate the VCF files (stored in the folder C:\repos\dnabr_afr\VCFs) and map the haplogroup for each one using the haloprogrep3 CLI application.
The haplogrep3.exe is already installed in the folder C:\repos\dnabr_afr\haplogrep
The documentation of haplogrep3 can be found here:
-	https://haplogrep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart/
-	https://haplogrep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameters/

First tasks for you:

(1)	Create a readable wrapper to use haplogrep3 in python.
(2)	Also, create a .md file with the details and examples of usage this wrapper in python projects.
(3)	Structure the folder according to best practices for python projects.
